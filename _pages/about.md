Hello My name is Avi Dube this websites purpose is to be a separate resume for all the cool things I do.
I am the main coder for the VEX robotics team 1961Z and the vice-president of my schools TSA Chapter.
I love space and it's wonders and aspire to be an aerospace enginner to help humanity get to Mars.
Even though that sounds super basic that is every aerospace engineers dream.
I hope you like the website :))))).
